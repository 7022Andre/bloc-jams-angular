## BlocJams Angular

The goal of this project was to rework the last project, Bloc Jams, using AngularJS. Although it had a steep learning curve, this project was a great introduction into a framework that I like to work with in the future. It prepared me for the next project, Bloc Chat. Throughout this project I used Git as the version control system. The source code to this project can be found here and the deployed application can be found here.
